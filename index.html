    <p>Citrullus lanatus, commonly known as watermelon, is a plant species in the family Cucurbitaceae, a vine-like (scrambler and trailer) flowering plant originating in West Africa. Watermelon is grown in tropical and subtropical
      areas worldwide for its large edible fruit, which is a special kind of berry with a hard rind and no internal division, botanically called a pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh is usually deep red to pink, with many black seeds, although seedless
      varieties have been cultivated. The fruit can be eaten raw or pickled and the rind is edible after cooking.</p>
